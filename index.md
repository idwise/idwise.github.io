# Developers Guide to Integrate With IDWise
There are many ways to integrate with our system, including a mobile SDK, or by sending images of documents through an API:

  </span>
</div>


## Client SDKs:
We strongly recommend using the following Client SDKs to integrate the IDWise KYC capability into your app, we strive to make the integration effort minimal while maintaining a rich and customisable experience:

-   [Android SDK](https://idwi.se/android)
-   [iOS SDK](https://idwi.se/ios)
-   [Web SDK (Javascript)](https://idwi.se/js)

Business ID (Journey Template ID) for the above client SDKs will be provided by the IDWise team.

## Backend API:
This API helps you get information about IDWise journeys from your backend.
Documentation for this API will be sent to you as part of your onboarding on the IDWise platform by the engineering team.

## Anti Money Laundering (AML) Standalone API: 
[AML Check service](https://idwi.se/aml) is an API that allows IDWise customers to search for individuals over Anti Money Laundering (AML) datasets which are updated daily, including Politically Exposed Person (PEPs) and global sanctions, and many more lists.

## API Key & Secret:
