# Developers Guide to Integrate With IDWise
There are many ways to integrate with our system, including a mobile SDK, or by sending images of documents through an API:

  </span>
</div>


## Client SDKs:
We strongly recommend using the following Client SDKs to integrate the IDWise KYC capability into your app, we strive to make the integration effort minimal while maintaining a rich and customisable experience:

-   [Android SDK](https://idwi.se/android)
-   [iOS SDK](https://idwi.se/ios)
-   [Web SDK (Javascript)](https://idwi.se/js)

Business ID (Journey Template ID) for the above client SDKs will be provided by the IDWise team.

## Backend API:
This API helps you get information about IDWise journeys from your backend.
You can find the [documentation here](https://idwi.se/journey-api).
