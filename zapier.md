[Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/idwise/integrations) lets you connect APP to 5,000+ other web services. Automated connections called Zaps, set up in minutes with no coding, can automate your day-to-day tasks and build workflows between apps that otherwise wouldn't be possible.

Each Zap has one app as the **Trigger**, where your information comes from and which causes one or more **Actions** in other apps, where your data gets sent automatically. 

## Getting Started with Zapier
Sign up for a free [Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/idwise/integrations) account, from there you can jump right in. To help you hit the ground running, here are some popular pre-made Zaps.

## How do I connect APP to Zapier?

Log in to your [Zapier account](https://zapier.com/sign-up) or create a new account.
Navigate to "My Apps" from the top menu bar.
Now click on "Connect a new account..." and search for "IDWise"
Use your credentials to connect your IDWise account to Zapier.
Once that's done you can start creating an automation! Use a pre-made Zap or create your own with the Zap Editor. Creating a Zap requires no coding knowledge and you'll be walked step-by-step through the setup.
