[Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/idwise/integrations) lets you connect IDWise to 5,000+ other web services. Automated connections called Zaps, set up in minutes with no coding, can automate your day-to-day tasks and build workflows between apps that otherwise wouldn't be possible.

Each Zap has one app as the **Trigger**, where your information comes from and which causes one or more **Actions** in other apps, where your data gets sent automatically. 

## Getting Started with Zapier
Sign up for a free [Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/idwise/integrations) account, from there you can jump right in. To help you hit the ground running, here are some popular pre-made Zaps.
