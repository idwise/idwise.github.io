==**1. Using Client SDK Events**==
Customer App (Android/iOS/Web)->IDWise SDK: **Start Journey** (referenceNo,...)

note over Customer App (Android/iOS/Web), IDWise SDK: Journey staps are completed by the user

IDWise SDK->Customer App (Android/iOS/Web): On Journey Compelte Call Back/event (journeyId)
Customer App (Android/iOS/Web) -> Customer Backend: Get Journey Details (journeyId)
Customer Backend -> IDWise Backend: api.idwise.com/journey/get/{{journeyId}}
IDWise Backend --> Customer Backend: Journey Details (Fields, Face Match, Validation,...) 
Customer Backend -->Customer App (Android/iOS/Web): Journey Details

note over Customer App (Android/iOS/Web): Use journey details to populate forms\nor control the flow of user journey\nin customer app



==**2. Using Webhooks (can be configured on customer account)**==
Customer App (Android/iOS/Web)->IDWise SDK: **Start Journey** (referenceNo)

note over Customer App (Android/iOS/Web), IDWise SDK: Journey staps are completed by the user

IDWise Backend->Customer Backend: Webhook on journey completed (journeyId, referenceNo)
Customer Backend -> IDWise Backend: api.idwise.com/journey/get/{{journeyId}}
IDWise Backend --> Customer Backend: Journey Details (Fields, Face Match, Validation,...) 

note over Customer Backend: Save journey details to a local database\nand use the data to update customer record\n(use referenceNo that was passed to\n`**Start Journey**` to link customer record to journey)
